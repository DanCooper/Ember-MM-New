Although this is a very young module, it should be able to fulfill all your need as a jukebox builder.
We are welcome to new features and improvements, and the time/effort that will be spent on it, depend not only but in a great amount on the number of users that will be using it as primary jukebox builder.
So, please give us your feedback.
